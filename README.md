# Budgetly (Vue.js v2 - Options API)

I created an interesting budget calculator with animation effects using **Vue.js** , **Vue Options API** , **Vue Router** , **Vue CLI** , **Tailwind CSS** , and **GSAP**. It's a **SPA** (single-page-application) that helps you to easily keep track of your incomes and expenses.

Here is [Another Version of This Project](https://github.com/ShayanTheNerd/Budgetly-Vue3-Composition-API) with **Vue.js v3** and **Vue Composition API**

In case you're intereseted, feel free to take a look at the source code at [SourceCode Branch](https://github.com/ShayanTheNerd/Budgetly-Vue2-Options-API/tree/SourceCode) and give it an update.
